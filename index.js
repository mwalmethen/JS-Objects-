/*****************************************************************
Part 1: Understanding Objects

You are given the task of representing a book in a library system. 
Use an object to model the book with the following information:

- Title: "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"
- Author: "David Flanagan"
- Published Year: 2020
- Genre: "Programming"

Task 1) Create an object named 'book' using curly braces {} that includes the information above.

Task 2) Print the bookâ€™s title with its publish year. Access the book title using dot-notation, and access the publish year using bracket-notation.
******************************************************************/
// object book that contains information about a library book titled JavaScript: The Defintive Guide // 
const book = {
    title: "JavaScript: The Defintive Guide",
    author: "David Flanagan",
    publishedYear: 2020,
    genre: "Programming"
};
console.log(book) // calling the object in the terminal 
console.log(book.title, book.publishedYear); // calling object title and year of publish 


/*****************************************************************
Part 2: Modifying Objects

Consider you need to update the book's information and add a new property:

Task 3) Add a property 'pageCount' with the value 1096 to the 'book' object.

Task 4) The book has been assigned an ISBN number. Add a property 'ISBN' with a value "978-1491952023".
        
Task 5) Modify the 'publishedYear' to 2021 as a new edition has been released.
******************************************************************/
/*****************************************************************/

// Task 3 // 
book.pageCount = 1096; // adding new propert pagecount 
console.log(book); // calling object with new property


// Task 4 // 
book.ISBN = "978-1491952023"; // we stored it as a string becasue of the "-" 
console.log(book); //  calling object with new property 


// Task 5 // 
book.publishedYear = 2021; // adding new year of publish 
console.log(book); // calling object with new changes 




/*****************************************************************
Part 3: Advanced Object Operations 

Your library system needs to handle multiple authors and include reviews for the book. 
Update the 'book' object to accommodate these requirements:

Task 6) Modify the 'author' property to hold an array of two authors: "David Flanagan" and "Another Author".

Task 7) Add a 'reviews' property to the 'book' object, which will store an array of review objects. 
        Each review object should have 'reviewer' and 'comment' properties. 
        Start with one review: {reviewer: "Book Critic", comment: "A comprehensive guide to JavaScript."}.
******************************************************************/

// Task 6 // 
book.author = ["David Flanagan", "Another Author"]; // creating an array with author names 
console.log(book); // calling object with new author names

// Task 7 // 
book.reviews = {  // creating an new object inside an object called review 
    reviewer: "Book Critic", // storing the reviewer 
    comment: "A comprehensive guide to JavaScript" // storing the comment by the reviewer 
};
console.log(book); // calling object with new changes
